# Exercise: Vowel Count

## Task
Implement a method that counts the number of vowels (a, e, i, o, u, both uppercase and lowercase) in a given string.

### Example
For the string `"hello world"`, your method should return `5` (since there are 3 vowels in "hello" and 2 vowels in "world").

## Instructions
1. Open the file `solution.rb` and implement the method `count_vowels`.
2. To test your solution, run the following command in the terminal:

```bash
ruby runner.rb vowel_count
```
