# Exercise: Anagram Check

## Task
Write a function that checks if two given strings are anagrams of each other. An anagram is a word or phrase formed by rearranging the letters of a different word or phrase, typically using all the original letters exactly once.

### Example
Given the strings "listen" and "silent", the function should return `true` because "listen" is an anagram of "silent".
Given the strings "hello" and "world", the function should return `false` because "hello" is not an anagram of "world".

## Instructions
To run the anagram check, use the following command:

```bash
ruby runner.rb anagram_check
```
