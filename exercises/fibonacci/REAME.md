# Exercise: Fibonacci Sequence

## Task

Write a class `Fibonacci` with a method `nth_fibonacci` that returns the nth Fibonacci number. The Fibonacci sequence is a series of numbers where each number is the sum of the two preceding ones, usually starting with 0 and 1.

### Example

Given `n = 0`, the method should return `0`.

Given `n = 1`, the method should return `1`.

Given `n = 2`, the method should return `1`.

Given `n = 3`, the method should return `2`.

Given `n = 5`, the method should return `5`.

Given `n = 10`, the method should return `55`.

## Instructions

To run the Fibonacci sequence test, use the following command:

```bash
ruby runner fibonacci
```
