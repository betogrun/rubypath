# Exercise: Prime Number Check

## Task
Implement a method that checks if a given number is prime. A prime number is a number greater than 1 that has no divisors other than 1 and itself.

### Example
For the number `7`, your method should return `true` (because 7 is a prime number).  
For the number `9`, your method should return `false` (because 9 is not a prime number).

## Instructions
1. Open the file `solution.rb` and implement the method `prime?`.
2. To test your solution, run the following command in the terminal:

```bash
ruby exercises/prime_number/runner.rb
